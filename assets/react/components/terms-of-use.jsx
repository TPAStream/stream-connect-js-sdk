          fullest extent of applicable laws to enforce these terms. TPA Stream
          retains the right to immediately terminate access to the Services
          without notice if in its sole determination it believes such
          termination is necessary to enforce the Terms, for the proper
          operation or security of the Services, or for the protection of its
          network, data, Site, the Intellectual Property rights of TPA Stream or
          a third party.

          <h3>16. Security and Password Management</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
          If any of the Services require you to open an account, you must
          complete the registration process by providing us with current,
          complete and accurate information as required by the applicable
          registration form. You may also be required to choose a password and a
          user name. Access to and use of password protected or secure areas of
          the Site are restricted to authorized users only. You agree not to
          share your password(s), account information, or access to the Site
          with any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the
          confidentiality of passwords and account information, and you are
          responsible for all activities that occur through the authorized use
          of your passwords or accounts. You agree to notify TPA Stream
          immediately of any use of your passwords or accounts that you did not
          authorize or that is not authorized by the Terms.

          <h3>17. General Terms</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>17.1 Notices</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          Official notices must be delivered by email to TPA Stream, at
          support@tpastream.com, Attn: Legal Department. Such notices will be
          effective upon delivery as reasonably verified by the delivery
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>17.2 Force Majeure</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither party will be liable to the other for any failure or delay in
          performance of an obligation, other than obligations to make payments,
          arising out of any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control
          of that party, including without limitation acts of God, earthquakes,
          fires, floods, power outages, interruptions in telecommunication
          services, strikes, and governmental actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>17.3 Assignment</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not assign or transfer any rights under the Terms, including
          your licenses to software, including in relation to the sale of a
          practice or business, to any third party without TPA Stream's prior
          written consent. Any unauthorized attempt to do so will be null and
          void.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>17.4 Export Obligations</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not export, directly or indirectly; any of the Services in
          violation of any U.S. export laws or regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>17.5 Waiver and Severance</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          TPA Stream's failure to enforce any provision of the Terms shall not
          constitute a waiver of such right. If any term of these Terms is found
          to be unenforceable, that term is to be modified to make that term
          legal and enforceable, and the balance of the Terms will continue in
          full force and effect, such change to be made in a manner to maximize
          the enforcement of the remaining terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>17.6 Minimum Age Requirement</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old or older to use the Services
          (including the Site).
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>17.7 Entire Agreement</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Terms, along with any Additional Terms, represent the final
          agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter, and
          supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or
          oral.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>17.8 Alternative Dispute Resolution and Choice of Law</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          Any dispute arising from the Terms or the Services, or otherwise
          between the parties, that is not resolved within forty five (45) days
          from a notice of such dispute to the other party, shall be addressed
          by convening an informal telephonic meeting between the most senior
          executive representative of each party, within seven (7) days from the
          end of the 45 day notice period. If the dispute cannot be resolved
          during such meeting, and after thirty (30) days written notice of such
          failure to reach a resolution, if such dispute is not resolved within
          such 30-day period, the parties agree to submit and settle the dispute
          by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
          Alternative Dispute Resolution Service under its Commercial
          Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall proceed before a panel of
          three (3) arbitrators, with one arbitrator selected by each party and
          the third being selected by mutual agreement of the parties. The
          arbitration shall proceed in Cleveland, OH, under the laws of the
          State of Ohio without regard to principles of conflicts of law.
          Judgment on any award rendered by the panel of arbitrators may be
          entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, located in Cleveland
          or Cuyahoga County, OH, and the Parties hereby consent to personal
          jurisdiction and venue therein. Any action relating to this Agreement
          must be commenced within one (1) year after the date upon which the
          cause of action accrued, or within the statute of limitations provided
          by the above agreed upon choice of law, whichever is less. The parties
          hereby waive any claim of lack of jurisdiction or inconvenient forum.
          BOTH PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION BY
          OR AGAINST EITHER PARTY RELATED TO THE SERVICES OR THE TERMS. THE
          PREVAILING PARTY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER
          REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS. To the extent allowed by law,
          you and TPA Stream agree that any proceedings to resolve or litigate
          any dispute, whether in arbitration, in court, or otherwise, will be
          conducted solely on an individual basis, and that neither you nor TPA
          Stream will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, a
          representative action, a collective action, a private attorney-general
          action, or in any proceeding in which you or TPA Stream acts or
          proposes to act in a representative capacity. You and TPA Stream
          further agree that no proceeding will be joined, consolidated, or
          combined with another proceeding without the prior written consent of
          you, TPA Stream, and all parties to any such proceeding. The
          provisions of this section are to be enforced to the maximum extent
          legally available.
